# 2048 &bull; [Demo](https://demo.mat.dev/2048/)

This is a reimplementation of Gabriele Cirulli's excellent [2048](https://play2048.co) game, built with React, Redux
and TypeScript. Unlike other React-based implementations, only functional components (with hooks) are used here. This project doesn't rely on canvas or element refs. This project was bootstrapped using the [mat-sz](https://github.com/mat-sz/cra-template-mat-sz) CRA template.

## Running/Development

As with many CRA-based application, 2048 can be run using the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Unit Tests

Several unit tests for game logic are available. You can run the test suite using:

```
yarn test
```
